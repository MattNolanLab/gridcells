What is ArmaNpy?
----------------

ArmaNpy is a set of SWIG interface files which allows for generating
Python bindings to C++ code which uses the Armadillo matrix library.
From within Python any Armadillo matrices are represented as NumPy matrices.
This is possible due to the same memory layout used.
Copying of memory is avoided whenever possible.

Usage
-----

See the file test/test.i how to use ArmaNpy to generate bindings for a set of classes
defines in test/test.hpp and test/test.cpp.
See test/armanpy_tests.py for the Python side of usage (Note that this file is jut unit tests).

How to compile and run the test?
--------------------------------

1) Use CMake to generate your build system based on the provided CMakeLists file in the test dir.
2) Build the resulting project.
3) Run the Python script armanpy_tests.py

From the command line this can be done as follows (adapt to your path settings and use '\' instedead of '/' on Windows):

cd /path/to/armanpy/test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/your/armadillo/include
cmake --build . --config Release
cd ..
python armanpy_tests.py --verbose
