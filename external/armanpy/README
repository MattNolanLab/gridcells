What is ArmaNpy?
----------------

ArmaNpy is a set of SWIG interface files which allows generating
Python bindings to C++ code which uses the Armadillo matrix library.
From within Python any Armadillo matrices are represented as NumPy matrices.
This is possible due to the same memory layout used.
Copying of memory is avoided whenever possible.
It also supports boost::shared_ptr wrapped return values of Armadillo matrices.

Usage
-----

For general information on how to use SWIG to generate python bindings see
http://www.swig.org/Doc2.0/Python.html.

See the file example/example.i and test/armanpy_test_lib.i how to use ArmaNpy
to generate bindings for a set of classes defined in example/example.hpp and
test/armanpy_test_lib.hpp.

See example/example.py and test/armanpy_test_run.py for the Python side of
usage (note that armanpy_test_run.py is just unit tests).

How to compile and run the example and the tests?
-------------------------------------------------

1) Use CMake to generate your build system based on the provided CMakeLists.txt file in the example or test dir.
2) Build the resulting project.
3) Run the Python script example.py or armanpy_tests.py

From the command line this can be done as follows for the example dir (adapt to your path settings and use '\' instedead of '/' on Windows). The same holds for the test dir.

cd /path/to/armanpy
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/your/armadillo/include
cmake --build . --config Release

The above commands will generate all necessary files in build/bin.

To run the tests and examples either run

ctest 

or 

cd bin
python example.py
python armanpy_test_run.py


*Note* : -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release is used bcs on Windows a typical Python distribution does not
come with the debug version of the Python libraries. Hence, the build would fail for the Debug
configuration.

*Remark* : To use 64bit under Windows add e.g. -G "Visual Studio 11 Win64" to the first cmake command.
