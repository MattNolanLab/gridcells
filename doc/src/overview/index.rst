What are grid cells
-------------------

Grid cells are a type of cells found in some mammalian species that have very
regular spatial firing fields. When these animals forage in experimental
arenas, grid cells are active only in certain places and the locations where
they are active form a hexagonal lattice. More information can be found in
[MOSER2007]_ or in [HAFTING2005]_.


What does :mod:`gridcells` do
-----------------------------

:mod:`gridcells` is a simple C++/Python library that aims to provide an open
source code repository related to analysis and simulations of grid cell models.
