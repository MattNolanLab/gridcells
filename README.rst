GridCells
=========

What are grid cells
-------------------

Grid cells are a type of cells found in some mammalian species that have very
regular spatial firing fields. When these animals forage in experimental
arenas, grid cells are active only in certain places and the locations where
they are active form a hexagonal lattice. More information can be found in
[MOSER2007]_ or in [HAFTING2005]_.


What does `gridcells` do
-----------------------------

`gridcells` is a simple Python library that aims to provide an open source code
repository related to analysis of grid cell related experiments and simulation
of models of grid cells.



Download
--------

`gridcells` can be downloaded from https://github.com/lsolanka/gridcells.


Dependencies
------------

There are a number of dependencies needed for the python version:
    - `armadillo <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_ (>= 4.100)

    - SWIG (>= 2.0)

    - numpy (>= 1.8)

    - scipy (>= 0.13.3)

For Linux, simply install these using the package manager.For Mac OS the
easiest way is probably to use `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_. This package has
not been tested on Windows but if you manage to install the dependencies there
should be no problems.


Installation
------------

After installing ``armadillo`` and ``SWIG``, run::

    python setup.py install

.. note::

    The automatic installation process is a work in progress and therefore,
    when using ``pip`` to install, ``numpy`` (in the minimal version) must
    already be installed before running ``pip install``.
